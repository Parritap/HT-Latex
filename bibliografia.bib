	abstract = {Cloud computing has become a very important computing model to process data and execute computationally concentrated applications in pay-per-use method. Resource allocation is a process in which the resources are allocated to consumers by cloud providers based on their flexible requirements. As the data is expanding every day, allocating resources efficiently according to the consumer demand has also become very important, keeping Service Level Agreement (SLA) between service providers and consumers in prospect. This task of resource allocation becomes more challenging due to finite available resources and increasing consumer demands. Therefore, many unique models and techniques have been proposed to allocate resources efficiently. In the light of the uniqueness of the models and techniques, the main aim of the resource allocation is to limit the overhead/expenses associated with it. This research aims to present a comprehensive, structured literature review on different aspects of resource allocation in cloud computing, including strategic, target resources, optimization, scheduling and power. More than 50 articles, between year 2007 and 2019, related to resource allocation in cloud computing have been shortlisted through a structured mechanism and they are reviewed under clearly defined objectives. It presents a topical taxonomy of resource allocation dimensions, and articles under each category are discussed and analysed. Lastly, salient future directions in this area are discussed.}

			Distributed computing is an activity that is performed on a spatially distributed system. An important problem in distributed computing is to provide a user with a non-distributed view of a distributed system to implement a distributed file system that allows the client programmer to ignore the physical location of his data. The models of computation generally considered to be distributed are process models in which the computational activity is represented as the concurrent execution of sequential processes. Different process models are distinguished by the mechanism employed for inter-process communication. The process models that are most distributed are the ones in which processes communicate by message passing. A process sends a message by adding it to a message queue and another process receives the message by removing it from the queue. There are two basic complexity measures for distributed algorithms: time and message complexity. The time complexity of an algorithm measures the time needed both for message transmission and for computation within the processes. The most common measure of message complexity is the total number of messages transmitted. If messages contain on the order of a few hundred bits or more, then the total number of bits sent might be a better measure of the cost than the number of messages.}

	abstract  = {While it is true that the modern computer is many orders of magnitude faster than that of yesteryear; this tremendous growth in CPU clock rates is now over. Unfortunately, however, the growth in demand for computational power has not abated; whereas researchers a decade ago could simply wait for computers to get faster, today the only solution to the growing need for more powerful computational resource lies in the exploitation of parallelism. Software parallelization falls generally into two broad categories—“true parallel” and high-throughput computing. This chapter focuses on the latter of these two types of parallelism. With high-throughput computing, users can run many copies of their software at the same time across many different computers. This technique for achieving parallelism is powerful in its ability to provide high degrees of parallelism, yet simple in its conceptual implementation. This chapter covers various patterns of high-throughput computing usage and the skills and techniques necessary to take full advantage of them. By utilizing numerous examples and sample codes and scripts, we hope to provide the reader not only with a deeper understanding of the principles behind high-throughput computing, but also with a set of tools and references that will prove invaluable as she explores software parallelism with her own software applications and research.}

	abstract  = {Self-adaptation has been driven by the need to achieve and maintain quality attributes in the face of the continuously changing requirements, as well as the uncertain demand during run-time. Designing architectures that exhibit a good trade-off between multiple quality attributes is challenging, especially in the case of self-adaptive software systems, due to the complexity, heterogeneity, and ultra-large scale of modern software systems. This challenge increases with the dynamic, open, and uncertain operating environment, as well as the need for complying to environmental, regulatory, and sustainability requirements; such as energy consumption regulations. This study aims at analyzing the research landscape that have explicitly addressed trade-offs management for self-adaptive software architectures, to obtain a comprehensive overview on the current state of research on this specialized area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research works related to analyzing and managing trade-offs to support decision-making for self-adaptive software architectures. Twenty primary studies were evidently selected and analyzed to classify software paradigms, quality attributes considered, and the self-* properties that drive trade-offs management. The results show constant interest in finding solutions for trade-offs management at design-time and run-time, as well as the success of research initiatives even when new research challenges are found. The findings call for foundational framework to analyze and manage trade-offs for self-adaptive software architectures that can explicitly consider specific multiple quality attributes, the run-time dynamics, the uncertainty of the environment and the complex challenges of modern, ultra-large scale systems in particular given software paradigms.}

	abstract = {In this paper, developments in digital computer technology since the early Fifties are reviewed briefly, and the parallelism which exists between these developments and developments in analysis and design procedures of structural engineering is identified. The recent trends in digital computer technology are examined in order to establish the fact that distributed processing is now an accepted philosophy for further developments. The impact of this on the analysis and design practices of structural engineering is assessed by first examining these practices from a data processing standpoint to identify the key operations and data bases, and then fitting them to the characteristics of distributed processing. The merits and drawbacks of the present philosophy in educating structural engineers are discussed and projections are made for the industry-academia relations in the distributed processing environment of structural analysis and design. An ongoing experiment of distributed computing in a University environment is described.}

	abstract = {The vision of creating a "virtual supercomputing" environment to solve large-scale scientific problems has largely been facilitated by the development and deployment of Grid middleware. However, with the deployment of multiple disconnected Grid environments, we are now faced with the problem of interoperable access to resources from multiple environments to meet the requirements of scientific applications. Within the U. S. cyberinfrastructure environments, two key elements: both the National Science Foundation TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid (OSG) provide varied but important capabilities and resources needed by diverse computational communities. Hence, it is critical to understand how these communities can benefit from bridging these different environments and utilize them when needed. In this paper we present a novel approach to interoperable access to both OSG and TeraGrid to users through the CyberGIS Gateway -- an online geographic information system. In particular, five key interoperability themes are addressed: authentication and authorization, information services, data management, and computation management and auditing. We take a scientific application use-case (viewshed analysis) on the CyberGIS Gateway to demonstrate how to exploit resources on both OSG and TeraGrid.},

abstract="In this paper we address the Sentiment Analysis problem from the end user's perspective. An end user might desire an automated at-a-glance presentation of the main points made in a single review or how opinion changes time to time over multiple documents. To meet the requirement we propose a relatively generic opinion 5Ws structurization, further used for textual and visual summary and tracking. The 5W task seeks to extract the semantic constituents in a natural language sentence by distilling it into the answers to the 5W questions: Who, What, When, Where and Why. The visualization system facilitates users to generate sentiment tracking with textual summary and sentiment polarity wise graph based on any dimension or combination of dimensions as they want i.e. ``Who'' are the actors and ``What'' are their sentiment regarding any topic, changes in sentiment during ``When'' and ``Where'' and the reasons for change in sentiment as ``Why''.",
